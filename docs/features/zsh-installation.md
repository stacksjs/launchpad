# Zsh Installation

Launchpad provides a dedicated command for installing the Zsh shell, making it easy to get a modern shell environment set up on any system.

## Quick Start

Install zsh with a single command:

```bash
launchpad zsh
```

This will:
1. Install the latest version of zsh through Launchpad's package registry
2. Add the installation directory to your PATH
3. Provide instructions for making zsh your default shell

## Installation Options

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Install zsh with default settings
launchpad zsh
```

### Custom Installation Path

```bash
# Install to a specific directory
launchpad zsh --path ~/my-shell

# Install to a system directory
launchpad zsh --path /usr/local
```

### Force Reinstallation

```bash
# Force reinstall even if zsh is already installed
launchpad zsh --force
```

### Disable Auto-PATH

```bash
# Install without automatically adding to PATH
launchpad zsh --no-auto-path
```

### Verbose Output

```bash
# See detailed installation information
launchpad zsh --verbose
```

## Making Zsh Your Default Shell

After installation, you'll want to make zsh your default shell. Launchpad provides helpful instructions after installation:

### Using the Installed Zsh

```bash
# Find the path to your installed zsh
which zsh

# Make it your default shell (replace with actual path)
chsh -s /path/to/installed/bin/zsh
```

### Using System Zsh

If you prefer to use the system's zsh (if available):

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

## Verification

After installation and shell change, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check zsh version
zsh --version

# Check your current shell
echo $SHELL

# Start a new zsh session
zsh
```

## Configuration

Once zsh is installed and set as your default shell, you might want to:

1. **Install a framework** like Oh My Zsh or Prezto
2. **Configure your `.zshrc`** file
3. **Install plugins** for enhanced functionality

### Oh My Zsh Installation

```bash
# Install Oh My Zsh (after zsh is your default shell)
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues:

```bash
# Use sudo if installing to system directories
sudo launchpad zsh --path /usr/local
```

### PATH Issues

If zsh isn't found after installation:

```bash
# Check if the bin directory is in your PATH
echo $PATH

# Manually add to PATH if needed
export PATH="/path/to/zsh/bin:$PATH"

# Add to your shell configuration permanently
echo 'export PATH="/path/to/zsh/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Shell Change Issues

If `chsh` doesn't work:

1. Make sure the zsh path is in `/etc/shells`:
   ```bash
   # Add your zsh path to allowed shells
   echo "/path/to/zsh/bin/zsh" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
   ```

2. Try changing shell as root:
   ```bash
   sudo chsh -s /path/to/zsh/bin/zsh $USER
   ```

## Comparison with Other Installation Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Launchpad** | Simple, cross-platform, automatic PATH management | Uses ts-pkgx registry |
| **Package Manager** | System integration | Platform-specific, may need sudo |
| **From Source** | Latest features | Complex, time-consuming |

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Zsh Versions

You can install zsh to different paths for testing:

```bash
# Install stable version
launchpad zsh --path ~/zsh-stable

# Install to another location for testing
launchpad zsh --path ~/zsh-test --force
```

### Integration with Development Environments

Zsh works great with Launchpad's dev-aware installations:

```bash
# Install dev package for project-specific environments
launchpad dev

# Use zsh in your development workflow
cd your-project
dev .
```
