# launchpad

> A modern dependency manager for your system and your projects. Effortlessly manage development tools, runtime environments, and project dependencies with automatic environment isolation. _Think Homebrew meets project-aware dependency management._

## What is Launchpad?

Launchpad is a comprehensive dependency management solution that bridges the gap between system-wide package management and project-specific environments. Whether you're setting up a new development machine, managing system tools, or working on projects with specific dependency requirements, Launchpad provides a unified interface for all your dependency needs.

**System Management:**
- Install and manage development tools system-wide
- Automatic PATH configuration and shell integration
- Cross-platform compatibility _(macOS, Linux, Windows)_
- Smart permission handling and installation paths

**Project Management:**
- Automatic project environment detection and activation
- Isolated dependency environments per project
- Version-specific tool installation
- Seamless switching between project contexts

At its core, Launchpad leverages pkgx's powerful package ecosystem while adding intelligent management, environment isolation, and developer-friendly workflows.

## Features

Launchpad transforms how you manage dependencies across your entire development workflow:

### System-Wide Dependency Management
- 📦 **Global Tool Installation** — Install development tools and runtimes system-wide with automatic PATH management
- 🔧 **Smart Installation Paths** — Automatically chooses `/usr/local` for system-wide access or `~/.local` for user-specific installs (pkgm compatible)
- 🔌 **Shell Integration** — Seamless integration with your shell for immediate tool availability
- 🪟 **Cross-Platform Support** — Consistent experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Project-Aware Environment Management
- 🌍 **Automatic Environment Isolation** — Project-specific environments that activate when you enter a project directory
- 🎯 **Dependency Detection** — Automatically reads `dependencies.yaml`, `package.json`, and other project files
- 🔄 **Context Switching** — Seamlessly switch between different project environments
- 📋 **Version Management** — Install and manage specific versions of tools per project
- 🗂️ **Environment Management** — List, inspect, clean, and remove project environments with readable identifiers

### Developer Experience
- ⚡ **Fast Operations** — Leverage pkgx for efficient package management
- 🗑️ **Clean Removal** — Remove packages or completely uninstall with proper cleanup
- 🔄 **Auto-Updates** — Configure automatic updates for your dependency management tools
- 🎛️ **Flexible Configuration** — Customize behavior through config files or command-line options

## Why Launchpad?

Modern development requires managing dependencies at multiple levels - from system tools to project-specific requirements. Traditional approaches fall short:

**Traditional Package Managers (Homebrew, apt, etc.):**
- ❌ **Global conflicts** — Different projects need different versions
- ❌ **Slow operations** — Installing or updating can take minutes
- ❌ **Manual environment management** — Switching between project contexts is manual
- ❌ **PATH pollution** — All tools are globally available, causing conflicts

**Manual Dependency Management:**
- ❌ **Inconsistent setups** — Different team members have different environments
- ❌ **Complex PATH management** — Manual shell configuration is error-prone
- ❌ **Version drift** — Hard to maintain consistent tool versions
- ❌ **Platform differences** — Different setup procedures for each OS

**Launchpad's Solution:**
- ✅ **Unified Management** — Single tool for both system and project dependencies
- ✅ **Automatic Isolation** — Project environments activate automatically
- ✅ **Fast Operations** — Efficient package management with intelligent caching
- ✅ **Consistent Experience** — Same commands and behavior across all platforms
- ✅ **Smart Defaults** — Sensible installation paths and configuration out of the box

## Installation

Get started with Launchpad through your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Install with Bun (recommended)
bun add -g @stacksjs/launchpad

# Or with npm
npm install -g @stacksjs/launchpad

# Or with yarn
yarn global add @stacksjs/launchpad

# Or with pnpm
pnpm add -g @stacksjs/launchpad
```

See [Installation Guide](https://github.com/stacksjs/launchpad/tree/main/docs/install.md) for more options.

## Quick Start

Launchpad is designed to handle both system setup and project management seamlessly! 🎯

### System Setup (First Time)

Bootstrap your development environment with everything you need:

```bash
# Complete system setup - installs to /usr/local by default
./launchpad bootstrap

# Or for a custom installation path
./launchpad bootstrap --path ~/.local --verbose

# Skip specific components if needed
./launchpad bootstrap --skip-bun --skip-shell-integration
```

The bootstrap command sets up your entire development foundation:

- ✅ Install Bun (JavaScript runtime)
- ✅ Configure your PATH automatically
- ✅ Set up shell integration for project auto-activation
- ✅ Provide clear next steps

### System-Wide Tool Management

Install and manage development tools across your entire system:

```bash
# Install essential development tools system-wide
launchpad install node python go rust

# Install specific versions
launchpad install node@22 python@3.12

# Install to /usr/local (default system-wide location)
launchpad install typescript --system

# Or specify any custom path
launchpad install docker --path /opt/tools

# Use shorthand for quick installs
launchpad i node@22 typescript@5.7
```

**Smart Installation Behavior:**
- **Default**: Installs to `/usr/local` if writable, otherwise `~/.local`
- **System-wide**: Use `--system` for explicit system installation (same as default)
- **Custom paths**: Use `--path <directory>` for any location
- **Automatic PATH**: Tools are immediately available in new shells

### Project Environment Management

Launchpad automatically manages project-specific dependencies:

```bash
# Create a project with dependencies
echo "dependencies:
  - node@22
  - typescript@5.7
  - bun@1.2" > dependencies.yaml

# Environment activates automatically when you enter the directory
cd my-project
# → ✅ Environment activated for /path/to/my-project

# Tools are available in project context
node --version  # Uses project-specific Node.js
tsc --version   # Uses project-specific TypeScript

# Leave project - environment deactivates automatically
cd ..
# → 🔄 Environment deactivated
```

**Supported Project Files:**
- `dependencies.yaml` / `dependencies.yml`
- `package.json` (Node.js projects)
- `pyproject.toml` (Python projects)
- `Cargo.toml` (Rust projects)
- And more...

### Environment Management

Manage your project environments with human-readable identifiers:

```bash
# List all development environments
launchpad env:list

# Inspect a specific environment
launchpad env:inspect my-project_1a2b3c4d

# Clean up old or failed environments
launchpad env:clean --dry-run

# Remove a specific environment
launchpad env:remove old-project_5e6f7g8h --force
```

**Environment Hash Format:** `{project-name}_{8-char-hex}`
- `final-project_7db6cf06` - Easy to identify and manage
- `working-test_208a31ec` - Human-readable project identification
- `my-app_1a2b3c4d` - Collision-resistant unique identifiers

### Package Management

Remove packages and manage your installation:

```bash
# Remove specific system tools
launchpad remove node python

# Remove project-specific versions (using uninstall command)
launchpad uninstall node@22

# See what would be removed
launchpad uninstall python --dry-run

# Complete system cleanup
launchpad clean --force
```

### Service Management

Manage long-running services like databases and web servers with ease:

```bash
# Start a service
launchpad start postgres
launchpad start redis
launchpad start nginx

# Stop a service
launchpad stop postgres

# Restart a service
launchpad restart redis

# Enable auto-start on boot
launchpad enable postgres
launchpad enable redis

# Disable auto-start
launchpad disable nginx

# Check service status
launchpad status postgres
launchpad status  # Show all services

# List all services
launchpad services
```

**Supported Services:**
- PostgreSQL (`postgres`)
- MySQL (`mysql`)
- Redis (`redis`)
- Nginx (`nginx`)
- MongoDB (`mongodb`)
- Memcached (`memcached`)
- RabbitMQ (`rabbitmq`)
- Elasticsearch (`elasticsearch`)
- Caddy (`caddy`)

**Service Features:**
- **Auto-initialization**: Services are automatically initialized with proper data directories and configuration
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both macOS (launchd) and Linux (systemd)
- **Health checks**: Built-in health monitoring for each service
- **Auto-restart**: Services automatically restart if they crash (when enabled)
- **Proper logging**: All service logs are centralized in `~/.local/share/launchpad/logs/`

### Advanced Operations

```bash
# Create executable shims
launchpad shim node@22 typescript@5.7

# List all installed packages
launchpad list

# Update packages
launchpad update node python --latest

# Cache management
launchpad cache:stats     # Show cache statistics
launchpad cache:clean     # Clean old cached packages
